# DNI

![sample-dni](./doc/dni.png)

This kata is related to the one my teacher did for class: [dfleta-dni](https://github.com/dfleta/Python_ejercicios/tree/master/Poo/DNI)

This is a kata in which i had a first look at the object-oriented programming (POO) and non-static classes, in which we will try to get the letter corresponding to each number using the NIF (fiscal identifier number) .

It consist in creating a program in which we give a number of 8 digits and the program returns their letter to get an identifier of Spain called "DNI".

Using a control digit that consist on dividing the NIF to 23, so the rest will be located in a assignment table which will return the letter corresponding to this control_digit(national document identifier).
